// UNIT 4 ASSESSMENT: Coding Practical Questions with Jest

// Please read all questions thoroughly
// Pseudo coding is REQUIRED
// If you get stuck, leave comments to help us understand your thought process

// Use test driven development to complete the following questions
// Add appropriate dependencies: $ yarn add jest

// Reminder: The test will call your function
// Run the file with the following command: $ yarn jest

// --------------------1) Prompt: Create a function that takes in a number (greater than 2) and returns an array containing the Fibonacci sequence. The length of the array is determined by the argument of the function.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

const fibonacciLength1 = 6
// Expected output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

const fibonacciLength2 = 10
// Expected output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.

// Pseudo code:

// --------------------2) Create a function that takes in an object that contains up votes and down votes and returns the end tally.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

const votes1 = { upVotes: 13, downVotes: 2 }
// Expected output: 11
const votes2 = { upVotes: 2, downVotes: 33 }
// Expected output: -31

// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.

// Pseudo code:
